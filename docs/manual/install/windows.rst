Installation on Windows with WSL2
#################################

With Windows 11 and WSL2 it is possible to use Intel OpenCL GPU support. Please
follow `Intel's documentation`_ for detailed installation procedure. Long story
short, you need to install WSL2 and Ubuntu 20.04 from Microsoft Store, then the
Intel `driver`_ *inside Windows* and then `OpenCL runtime`_ *inside Ubuntu 20.04
running in the WSL*. After that, follow the normal installation procedure
(without the nvidia packages) described in :ref:`ubuntu24.04`.
