## What is the UFO framework?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ufo-kit/ufo-core.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ufo-kit/ufo-core)

UFO is a multi-threaded, GPU-enabled and distributed data processing
*framework*. It provides base classes, scheduler implementations and run-time
management to describe a workflow as a graph of processing nodes. The nodes are
implemented as plugins in the
[ufo-filters](https://github.com/ufo-kit/ufo-filters) sister project.

The [ufo-python-tools](https://github.com/ufo-kit/ufo-python-tools) suite
provides functions for better integration within Python-based projects. The
[ufo-scripts](https://github.com/ufo-kit/ufo-scripts) project is a collection of
small programs for offline reconstruction of tomographic data using the UFO
framework. A wide range of sample programms that test the framework can be found
in the [ufo-tests](https://github.com/ufo-kit/ufo-tests) project.
